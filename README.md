# Welcome

This is an experimental programming language inspired by Haskell and C++ template metaprogramming.

## Build & Run

### Dependencies

- C++17 compiler
- readline
- boost

### How to build

Run following steps in terminal to compile the language:

```
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### How to run

To run interpreter, execute `Language` binary.

To run tests, execute `ctest` from `build` directory.

## Core Ideas

### Philosophy

- Protect from as many mistakes as possible with type system

- Maximize readability by separating algorithm and data from implementation details

- Provide the highest level of abstraction, expressiveness and concision

Examples and detailed description will be added soon.

## Thanks for visiting!

More examples and introductions will appear here soon. If you are interested, check back shortly.
